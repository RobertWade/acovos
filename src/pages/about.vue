            acovos is recognizing the importance of biospecimens as essential tools for drug and diagnostic development
            by becoming a worldwide provider of high quality, well-characterized human tissue samples to scientists in
            pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. <br>
            <span class="text-primary--d2 cursor-pointer" @click="$router.push('/more')">Acovosâ€™ well-established human
                tissue heritage</span> contains samples not only from a wide range of different
            tumor entities but also from a broad spectrum of inflammatory or degenerative diseases. Matched pairs of
            normal/tumor tissue or primary/relapsed tumor tissue and other combinations help to enhance the selection of
            most promising drug candidates and development of new in vitro diagnostic products.
